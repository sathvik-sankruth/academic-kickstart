**Project Proposal:**

**Why someone will need this app?**

Nowadays people spend their time online for many activities such as surfing the web, learning new things, watching movies, listening to music and many more. Among these YouTube has taken a significant stage. However there is no application to view the most liked, most commented, most viewed videos ever. YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that theyâ€™re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year. Due to this there exists a requirement for an application that can make suggestions to the user. People can look online for the most viewed videos. But by making a system that can recommend saves the user time and streamlines the whole process.
