Project Proposal:

Why someone will need this app?

These days nearly everybody watches Youtube videos. However there is no application to view the most liked, most commented, most viewed videos ever. YouTube uses a combination of factors including measuring users interactions (number of views, shares, comments and likes). Note that theyâ€™re not the most-viewed videos overall for the calendar year. Due to this there exists a requirement for an application that can make suggestions to the user. People can look online for the most viewed videos. But by making a system that can recommend saves the user time and streamlines the whole process.
